I started two m1.medium AWS instances.  One one side I started one of the 
servers and the other side I ran the following code:

    wsdemo_stats:start_link("ec2-50-17-58-219.compute-1.amazonaws.com",
                            8000, 10000),
    spawn(fun() -> timer:sleep(5 * 60 * 1000),
                   error_logger:info_msg("Result: ~p~n", 
                   [wsdemo_stats:stats()]) end).

After 5 minutes of running, the following stats are outputed.
